# DAQDevice Wrapper

Using NIs DAQMx library and from the examples they provided, a wrapper library is created in order to ease the data collection process using NIs daq devices.

The device I use is NI-USB-6361 with bnc inputs.

Wrapper allows the user to start sampling <b>synchronously</b> or <b>asynchronously</b>.

Usage is quite straightforward, please follow the test project.
